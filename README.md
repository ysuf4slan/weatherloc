• With WeatherLoc, instead of getting lost in complex interfaces, I aimed for an experience that appeals to every user, where you can access the weather simply by clicking on your desired location, especially during your travels.


• To make the application performant, I maximized the fluidity on the map by using a 4-core parallel data downloading infrastructure and a 150 MB smart disk cache.


• While building the application, I used modern AI tools as a technical partner to structure the architecture and utilized Pixabay content for in-app vector assets.


• You can download the latest APK file from the [Releases](https://github.com/yusf4slan/app-weatherloc/releases/latest).
